item4248	o justify its priorities, the report proceeds on the premise that upends the historical consensus of what Constitutions and rights exist to do.
item4249	Protect every citizen of the republic against incursions into the vast repository of freedoms that exist naturally. 
item4250	The report says that to see the individual as an atomised unit, standing apart from the collective.
item4251	Neither flows from our constitutional framework nor accurately grasps the true nature of rights litigations. 
item4252	Rights (of which the right to privacy is an example) are not deontological categories that protect interests of atomised individuals. 
item4253	Then, it proceeds to conclude, Thus the construction of a right itself is not because it translates into an individual good, be it autonomy, speech, etc." 
item4254	But because such good creates a collective culture where certain reasons for state action are unacceptable.
item4255	Much of this language is inscrutable to even the legally trained mind.
item4256	To the extent that its import can be made out, the argument seems to be a strained, convoluted and ultimately unconvincing attempt.
item4257	To re-litigate the case of the government in the right to privacy issue. 
item4258	To the reports view that the individual ought not to be the spotlighted while making a law, the right to privacy judgment is in stark contrast. 
item4259	In Justice Kaul's words, Constitutions like our own are means by which individuals the Preambular people of India create the state.
item4260	A new entity to serve their interests and be accountable to them.
item4261	Moreover, in Justice Chandrachuds words: The individual is the focal point of the Constitution".
item4262	Because it is in the realisation of individual rights that the collective well being of the community is determined.
item4263	It is the reports approach to rights that is perhaps of most concern for the health of our democracy. 
item4264	Its statement that rights are not deontological categories is both unnecessarily complicated in its wording and patently untrue in its content. 
item4265	By using language like this, the report, already a technical document published only in English.
item4266	Alienates ordinary Indians from engaging with a subject of real significance to each of us. 
item4267	Our fundamental rights, whether to speech, equality or practice our religion or profession,
item4268	Are all essential facets that make life worth living and are held up by the right to privacy with regard to information about us. 
item4269	In stating that rights are not things which are essential in themselves is an unacceptable position to take under our Constitution. 
item4270	In fact, in the right to privacy judgment, Justice Kaul approves of the principle that liberty.
item4271	It is not often that nine judges of the Supreme Court assemble and pronounce a unanimous judgment without dissent. 
item4272	The promise of such a holding becomes more critical when it concerns the liberty of individuals and an attempt to correct an imbalance of power which exists against them. 
item4273	The advice was good; but James was in no condition to take it. His understanding had always been dull and feeble; 
item4274	And, such as it was, womanish tremors and childish fancies now disabled him from using it. 
item4275	He was aware that his flight was the thing which his adherents most dreaded and which his enemies most desired. 
item4276	Even if there had been serious personal risk in remaining, the occasion was one on which he ought to have thought it infamous to flinch: 
item4277	For the question was whether he and his posterity should reign on an ancestral throne or should be vagabonds and beggars. 
item4278	But in his mind all other feelings had given place to a craven fear for his life. 
item4279	To the earnest entreaties and unanswerable arguments of the agents whom his friends had sent to Rochester, he had only one answer. 
item4280	His head was in danger. In vain he was assured that there was no ground for such an apprehension, that common sense, 
item4281	If not principle, would restrain the Prince of Orange from incurring the guilt and shame of regicide and parricide, and that many, 
item4282	Who never would consent to depose their Sovereign while he remained on English ground, would think themselves absolved from their allegiance by his desertion.
item4283	Fright overpowered every other feeling. James determined to depart; and it was easy for him to do so. 
item4284	He was negligently guarded: all persons were suffered to repair to him: vessels ready to put to sea lay at no great distance; 
item4285	And their boats might come close to the garden of the house in which he was lodged. Had he been wise, 
item4286	The pains which his keepers took to facilitate his escape would have sufficed to convince him that he ought to stay where he was. 
item4287	In truth the snare was so ostentatiously exhibited that it could impose on nothing but folly bewildered by terror.

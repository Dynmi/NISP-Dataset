item3440	A Nehruvian moment which one senses as lacking today in this time of the Rohingya crisis and the National Register of Citizens threatening to extern lakhs of people.
item3441	No one has spoken with greater gratitude to India than the Dalai Lama. 
item3442	His rituals of thanks to India as a civilisation and to the Indian regime have been many. 
item3443	By welcoming him to India, we added to the sense of India. 
item3444	Yet, newspapers reported that in the anniversary speech, he said India had missed a moral opportunity.
item3445	Mahatma Gandhi, to avoid Partition, offered Muhammad Ali Jinnah the Prime Ministership, and Nehru objected because he wanted to lead India. 
item3446	The newspaper reports came out boldly and literally. 
item3447	A few days later, true to a spirit of correctness, the Dalai Lama withdrew his statement, saying that he had hurt feelings.
item3448	At a level of formal correctness, the matter is closed, but India is the loser because our prickly sense of arrogance blinded us to the possibility of the story.
item3449	The Dalai Lama was not criticising Nehru. He was merely pointing to glimpses of history beyond Nehru. 
item3450	He was being thoughtful, provocative, in a pedagogic way, because he was confident in himself and the people he was talking about. 
item3451	As a spiritual leader and as an astute politician, he was using the occasion to open us to new possibilities. 
item3452	Anyone living in India knows that our sense of nationalism has blinded us to alternative possibilities. 
item3453	We conceive of history as a fait accompli and with a dose of fatalism.
item3454	Yet, what the Dalai Lama is pointing out is that what we saw as a moment of closure had its openings. 
item3455	The greatness of Gandhi recognised it and pursued it with a desperation. 
item3456	Gandhi tried to thwart Partition by offering Jinnah something he would not have dreamed of.
item3457	Gandhi offered him the possibility of a giant leadership, the possibility of being leader of a joint India-Pakistan. 
item3458	Instead of Partition we could or could have had a united India. It was an act which required a surreal moral courage. 
item3459	It was an appeal to Jinnah to go beyond divisive politics. It was almost a utopian solution to a communal fissure.
item3460	The Dalai Lama suggests that Nehru refuted such a possibility. 
item3461	The historian in him must have seen it as impractical; the politician in him must have read it as insulting, wondering whether Gandhi had lost his sense of the bloody reality facing India.
item3462	Jinnah, Nehru and Mountbatten were responding at the level of realpolitik. It is the level at which history took place and Partition became inevitable.
item3463	The Dalai Lama understands history. As a political leader, he has an acute sense of it. 
item3464	But as a spiritual leader, he is suggesting decades after the event that history could have been transcended morally. 
item3465	The Bishop requested a copy of the Commission in order that he might know by what authority he was thus interrogated. 
item3466	"If you mean," said Jeffreys, "to dispute our authority, I shall take another course with
item3467	you. As to the Commission, I do not doubt that you have seen it. At all events you may see it in any coffeehouse for a penny." 
item3468	The insolence of the Chancellor's reply appears to have shocked the other Commissioners, and he was forced to make some awkward apologies. 
item3469	He then returned to the point from which he had started. 
item3470	"This," he said, "is not a court in which written charges are exhibited. Our proceedings are summary, and by word of mouth. The question is a plain one. Why did you not obey the King?" 
item3471	With some difficulty Compton obtained a brief delay, and the assistance of counsel. 
item3472	When the case had been heard, it was evident to all men that the Bishop had done only what he was bound to do. 
item3473	The Treasurer, the Chief Justice, and Sprat were for acquittal. The King's wrath was moved. 
item3474	It seemed that his Ecclesiastical Commission would fail him as his Tory Parliament had failed him. 
item3475	He offered Rochester a simple choice, to pronounce the Bishop guilty, or to quit the Treasury. 
item3476	Rochester was base enough to yield. Compton was suspended from all spiritual functions; and the charge of his great diocese was committed to his judges, Sprat and Crewe. 
item3477	He continued, however, to reside in his palace and to receive his revenues; 
item3478	For it was known that, had any attempt been made to deprive him of his temporalities, 
item3479	He would have put himself under the protection of the common law; and Herbert himself declared that, at common law, judgment must be given against the crown.

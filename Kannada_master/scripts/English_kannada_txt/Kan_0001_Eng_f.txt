item2349	When he made that plangent reference to Bose, Nehru extinguished himself for that moment on the ramparts and stood Netaji in what was his own place.

item2352	Bose, with Abid Hasan, coined the phrase Jai Hind but Nehru gave that coinage currency, at the Red Fort, by ending his speech with it that day and every single Independence Day,thereafter.
item2353	Hind has become, over the decades, an idea, a metaphor. It brings to Indias great name, Bharat, the vitality of its human emotions.

item2365	But do not catch me alone, catch all the colleagues of mine if mistakes are committed. That is the kind of peoples power we want to build.

item2382	The corporations were filled with his creatures. 
item2383	His revenues far exceeded those of his predecessors. His pride rose high. 
item2384	He was not the same man who, a few months before, in doubt whether his throne might not be overturned in a hour, 
item2385	Had implored foreign help with unkingly supplications, and had accepted it with tears of gratitude.

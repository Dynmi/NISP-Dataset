item0283	In this way, then, the recognition of the community of _personality_ between ourselves and the universal undifferentiated Spirit, which is the root and substance of all things, 
item0284	Solves the question of our release from the iron grasp of an inflexible Law, not by abrogating the Law, which would mean the annihilation of all things, 
item0285	But by producing in us an intelligence equal in affinity with the universal Law itself, and thus enabling us to apprehend and meet the requirements of the Law in each particular as it arises. 
item0286	In this way the Cosmic Intelligence becomes individualized, and the individual intelligence becomes universalized; 
item0287	The two became one, and in proportion as this unity is realized and acted on, it will be found that the Law, which gives rise to all outward conditions, 
item0288	Whether of body or of circumstances, becomes more and more clearly understood, and can therefore be more freely made use of, 
item0289	So that by steady, intelligent endeavour to unfold upon these lines we may reach degrees of power to which it is impossible to assign any limits. 
item0290	The student who would understand the rationale of the unfoldment of his own possibilities must make no mistake here. 
item0291	He must realize that the whole process is that of bringing the universal within the grasp of the individual by raising the individual to the level of the universal and not vice-versa. 
item0292	It is a mathematical truism that you cannot contract the infinite, and that you _can_ expand the individual; 
item0293	And it is precisely on these lines that evolution works. 
item0294	The laws of nature cannot be altered in the least degree; 
item0295	But we can come into such a realization of our own relation to the universal principle of Law that underlies them as to be able to press all particular laws, 
item0296	Whether of the visible or invisible side of Nature, into our service and so find ourselves masters of the situation. 
item0297	This is to be accomplished by knowledge; 
item0298	And the only knowledge which will effect this purpose in all its measureless immensity is the knowledge of the personal element in Universal Spirit in its reciprocity to our own personality. 
item0299	Our recognition of this Spirit must therefore be twofold, as the principle of necessary sequence, order or Law, and also as the principle of Intelligence, responsive to our own recognition of it.

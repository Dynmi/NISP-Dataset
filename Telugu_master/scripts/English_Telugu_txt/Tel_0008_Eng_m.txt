item0325	The question then arises, how can the healer substitute his own conscious mind for that of the patient? and the answer shows the practical application of those very abstract principles which I have laid down in the earlier sections. 
item0326	Our ordinary conception of ourselves is that of an individual personality which ends where another personality begins, in other words that the two personalities are entirely separate. 
item0327	This is an error. 
item0328	There is no such hard and fast line of demarcation between personalities, and the boundaries between one and another can be increased or reduced in rigidity according to will, 
item0329	In fact they may be temporarily removed so completely that, for the time being, the two personalities become merged into one. 
item0330	Now the action which takes place between healer and patient depends on this principle. 
item0331	The patient is asked by the healer to put himself in a receptive mental attitude, which means that he is to exercise his volition for the purpose of removing the barrier of his own objective personality and thus affording entrance to the mental power of the healer. 
item0332	On his side also the healer does the same thing, only with this difference, that while the patient withdraws the barrier on his side with the intention of admitting a flowing-in, 
item0333	The healer does so with the intention of allowing a flowing-out: and thus by the joint action of the two minds the barriers of both personalities are removed and the direction of the flow of volition is determined, 
item0334	That is to say, it flows from the healer as actively willing to give, towards the patient as passively willing to receive, according to the universal law of Nature that the flow must always be from the _plenum_ to the _vacuum_. 
item0335	This mutual removal of the external mental barrier between healer and patient is what is termed establishing a _rapport_ between them, 
item0336	And here we find one most valuable practical application of the principle laid down earlier in this book,that pure spirit is present in its entirety at every point simultaneously. 
item0337	It is for this reason that as soon as the healer realizes that the barriers of external personality between himself and his patient have been removed, 
item0338	He can then speak to the sub-conscious mind of the patient as though it were his own, for both being pure spirit the _thought_ of their identity _makes_ them identical, 
item0339	And both are concentrated into a single entity at a single point upon which the conscious mind of the healer can be brought to bear, according to the universal principle of the control of the subjective mind by the objective mind through suggestion. 
item0340	It is for this reason I have insisted on the distinction between _pure_ spirit, or spirit conceived of apart from extension in any matrix and the conception of it as so extended.
item0341	If we concentrate our mind upon the diseased condition of the patient we are thinking of him as a separate personality, and are not fixing our mind upon that conception of him as pure spirit which will afford us effectual entry to his springs of being. 
item0342	We must therefore withdraw our thought from the contemplation of symptoms, and indeed from his corporeal personality altogether, and must think of him as a purely spiritual individuality, 
item0343	And as such entirely free from subjection to any conditions, and consequently as voluntarily externalizing the conditions most expressive of the vitality and intelligence which pure spirit is. 
item0344	Thinking of him thus, we then make mental affirmation that he shall build up outwardly the correspondence of that perfect vitality which he knows himself to be inwardly;

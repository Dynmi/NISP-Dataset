item0116	Form implies extension in space and also limitation within certain boundaries.Thought implies neither. 
item0117	When, therefore, we think of Life as existing in any particular _form_ we associate it with the idea of extension in space, 
item0118	So that an elephant may be said to consist of a vastly larger amount of living substance than a mouse. 
item0119	But if we think of Life as the fact of livingness we do not associate it with any idea of extension,
item0120	And we at once realize that the mouse is quite as much alive as the elephant, notwithstanding the difference in size. 
item0121	The important point of this distinction is that if we can conceive of anything as entirely devoid of the element of extension in space, 
item0122	It must be present in its entire totality anywhere and everywhere--that is to say, at every point of space simultaneously. 
item0123	The scientific definition of time is that it is the period occupied by a body in passing from one given point in space to another,
item0124	And, therefore, according to this definition, when there is no space there can be no time; 
item0125	And hence that conception of spirit which realizes it as devoid of the element of space must realize it as being devoid of the element of time also;
item0126	And we therefore find that the conception of spirit as pure Thought, and not as concrete Form, is the conception of it as subsisting perfectly independently of the elements of time and space. 
item0127	From this it follows that if the idea of anything is conceived as existing on this level it can only represent that thing as being actually present here and now. 
item0128	In this view of things nothing can be remote from us either in time or space: either the idea is entirely dissipated or it exists as an actual present entity, 
item0129	And not as something that _shall_ be in the future, for where there is no sequence in time there can be no future. 
item0130	Similarly where there is no space there can be no conception of anything as being at a distance from us. 
item0131	When the elements of time and space are eliminated all our ideas of things must necessarily be as subsisting in a universal here and an everlasting now. 
item0132	This is, no doubt, a highly abstract conception, but I would ask the student to endeavour to grasp it thoroughly, 
item0133	Since it is of vital importance in the practical application of Mental Science, as will appear further on.

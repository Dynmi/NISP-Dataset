item0072	At first we may be disposed to say that livingness consists in the power of motion and deadness in its absence; 
item0073	But a little enquiry into the most recent researches of science will soon show us that this distinction does not go deep enough. 
item0074	It is now one of the fully-established facts of physical science that no atom of what we call "dead matter" is without motion. 
item0075	On the table before me lies a solid lump of steel, but in the light of up-to-date science I know that the atoms of that seemingly inert mass are vibrating with the most intense energy, 
item0076	Continually dashing hither and thither, impinging upon and rebounding from one another, or circling round like miniature solar systems, 
item0077	With a ceaseless rapidity whose complex activity is enough to bewilder the imagination. 
item0078	The mass, as a mass, may lie inert upon the table; 
item0079	But so far from being destitute of the element of motion it is the abode of the never-tiring energy moving the particles with a swiftness to which the speed of an express train is as nothing. 
item0080	It is, therefore, not the mere fact of motion that is at the root of the distinction which we draw instinctively between spirit and matter; we must go deeper than that. 
item0081	The solution of the problem will never be found by comparing Life with what we call deadness, and the reason for this will become apparent later on; 
item0082	But the true key is to be found by comparing one degree of livingness with another. 
item0083	There is, of course, one sense in which the quality of livingness does not admit of degrees; 
item0084	But there is another sense in which it is entirely a question of degree. 
item0085	We have no doubt as to the livingness of a plant, but we realize that it is something very different from the livingness of an animal. 
item0086	Again, what average boy would not prefer a fox-terrier to a goldfish for a pet? 
item0087	Or, again, why is it that the boy himself is an advance upon the dog? 
item0088	The plant, the fish, the dog, and the boy are all equally _alive_; 
item0089	But there is a difference in the quality of their livingness about which no one can have any doubt, 
item0090	And no one would hesitate to say that this difference is in the degree of intelligence.

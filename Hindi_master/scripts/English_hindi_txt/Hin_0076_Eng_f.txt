item7271	Letting go is probably one story lesson that can teach both the child and the parent a valuable lesson.
item7272	 Children are hands down very impressionable and sensitive, and there are times when you as a parent might not want to accept that a line needs to be drawn, they need to become independent.
item7273	Therefore, here is a story that talks about the challenges of learning to do things on your own through stronger roots.
item7274	Once there lived two neighbours who used to grow the same plants in their respective gardens.
item7275	 One neighbour was fussy and took extreme care of her plants.
item7276	 The other neighbour did what was required but left leaves of the plants alone to grow as they pleased.
item7277	On a fine evening, there was a huge storm, accompanied by rainfall.
item7278	 The storm destroyed many of the plants.
item7279	The next morning, when the fussy neighbour woke up, she found that the plants have had been uprooted and destroyed.
item7280	 However, when the more relaxed neighbour woke up, she found that though the damage to her plants was minor her plants were still firmly rooted.
item7281	The plant of the relaxed neighbour had learnt to do things on its own.
item7282	 So, it had done its bit of work, grown deep roots, and made a place for itself in the soil.
item7283	 Thus, it had stood firm even in the storm.
item7284	 However, the fussy neighbour used to do everything for the plant, thereby not teaching the plant how to sustain on its own.
item7285	Moral Of The Story:Sooner or later, you have to let go and become independent. Unless you stop fussing, nothing will work on its own.
item7286	 The plant of the normal neighbour had done its bit of work and made a place for itself thereby standing firm.
item7287	 The fussy neighbour did everything for the plant, thereby not teaching the plant how to sustain on its own.

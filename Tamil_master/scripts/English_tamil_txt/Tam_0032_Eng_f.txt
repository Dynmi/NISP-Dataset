item9132	Given the vulnerability of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh to cyclones, the frequency and intensity of which may be influenced by a changing climate, the Centre should press for global environmental funding under the UN framework to help in the rebuilding.
item9133	Both States have received funding from the World Bank in cyclone risk mitigation efforts since twenty eleven.

item9145	Venezuelan Opposition leader Juan Guaid has been trying to oust President Nicolas Maduro for months.
item9146	Last week, in his most daunting effort yet, he called for a military uprising.
item9147	Hours later, the U.S., which has recognised him as Venezuela's President, supported his bid.
item9148	A few soldiers broke ranks with the military and joined him, along with tens of thousands of protesters who battled for two days with police and government supporters.
item9149	Still, Mr.Guaid failed to topple the Maduro regime.
item9150	This was the third major attempt by Mr.Guaid to seize the government.
item9151	In January he declared himself President, saying Mr.Maduro's presidency was not legitimate as he had rigged? last year's election.
item9152	Since then, the U.S.has imposed sanctions on top Venezuelan government officials and the state-run oil company PDVSA on the calculation that these would make the already battered Venezuelan economy worse, rendering Mr.Maduro even more unpopular.
item9153	In February, Mr.Guaid launched another bid when he went to the Colombia border to accept U.S.aid, which the government had rejected.
item9154	He called for mass protests, but Mr.Maduro survived.
item9155	Last week's failed attempt was Mr.Guaid's biggest setback so far.

item9157	In a small Italian town, hundreds of years ago, a small business owner owed a large sum of money to a loan-shark. 
item9158	The loan-shark was a very old, unattractive looking guy that just so happened to fancy the business owner's daughter.
item9159	He decided to offer the businessman a deal that would completely wipe out the debt he owed him. 
item9160	However, the catch was that we would only wipe out the debt if he could marry the businessman's daughter.
item9161	Needless to say, this proposal was met with a look of disgust.
item9162	The loan-shark said that he would place two pebbles into a bag, one white and one black.
item9163	The daughter would then have to reach into the bag and pick out a pebble. 
item9164	If it was black, the debt would be wiped, but the loan-shark would then marry her. 
item9165	If it was white, the debt would also be wiped, but the daughter wouldn't have to marry the loan-shark.
item9166	Standing on a pebble-strewn path in the businessman's garden, the loan-shark bent over and picked up two pebbles.
item9167	Whilst he was picking them up, the daughter noticed that he'd picked up two black pebbles and placed them both into the bag.
item9168	He then asked the daughter to reach into the bag and pick one.
item9169	The daughter naturally had three choices as to what she could have done:
item9170	Refuse to pick a pebble from the bag.
item9171	Take both pebbles out of the bag and expose the loan-shark for cheating.
item9172	Pick a pebble from the bag fully well knowing it was black and sacrifice herself for her father's freedom.
item9173	She drew out a pebble from the bag, and before looking at it accidentally' dropped it into the midst of the other pebbles. She said to the loan-shark;
item9174	Oh, how clumsy of me. Never mind, if you look into the bag for the one that is left, you will be able to tell which pebble I picked.?
item9175	The pebble left in the bag is obviously black, and seeing as the loan-shark didn't want to be exposed, he had to play along as if the pebble the daughter dropped was white, and clear her father's debt.
item9176	Moral of the story: It's always possible to overcome a tough situation throughout of the box thinking, and not give in to the only options you think you have to pick from.

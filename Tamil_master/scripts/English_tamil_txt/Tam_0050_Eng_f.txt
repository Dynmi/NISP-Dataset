item9782	The Reserve Bank of Indiaâ€™s decision last week to resort to a dollar-rupee swap, instead of the traditional open-market purchase of bonds, to infuse liquidity into the economy marks a significant shift in the central bankâ€™s liquidity management policy.
item9783	Under the three-year currency swap scheme, which is scheduled to open on Tuesday next week, the RBI will purchase dollar five billion from banks in exchange for rupees.
item9784	The central bank will infuse as much as rupees thirty five thousand crore into the system in one shot at a time when liquidity generally tends to be squeezed.
item9785	For the banks, it is a way to earn some interest out of the forex reserves lying idle in their kitty.
item9786	Apart from injecting fresh liquidity into the economy, the move will have implications for the currency market even as it helps shore up the RBIâ€™s dollar reserves.
item9787	Bond yields rose on the day following the announcement of the swap scheme last week, reflecting the prevailing opinion among traders that the RBI may gradually reduce its dependence on the regular bond purchase scheme to manage liquidity within the economy.
item9788	While traditional open market operations distort the bond market, the new forex swap scheme will introduce new distortions in the currency market.
item9789	The rupeeâ€™s recent rally against the dollar has been halted by the RBIâ€™s decision to infuse rupees and suck out dollars through the swap scheme.
item9790	Even so, it is worth noting that the rupee has appreciated significantly in value terms against the dollar since the low reached in October as foreign investors have begun to pour money into the Indian economy.
item9791	Overall, the dollar-rupee swap is a useful addition to the RBIâ€™s policy toolkit as it offers the central bank a chance to directly influence both the value of the rupee and the amount of liquidity in the economy at the same time using a single tool.
item9792	In the aftermath of the liquidity crisis in the non-banking financial sector, it can be an effective way to lower private borrowing costs as well.
item9793	The coming elections, which can lead to an increase in cash withdrawals from banks, may have also played a role in the RBIâ€™s larger decision to boost liquidity in the system.
item9794	The way banks respond after receiving fresh liquidity from the RBI, however, will determine the success of the new liquidity scheme to a large extent.
item9795	Businesses could benefit from the greater availability of liquidity, but only if banks aggressively pass on the benefit of lower rates to their borrowers.
item9796	If banks choose to deposit the fresh RBI money in safe government securities at low yields, as they have done in the past, the de facto cap on the governmentâ€™s borrowing costs will remain intact.
item9797	But if banks manage to find alternative ways to deploy their money, the RBIâ€™s new liquidity scheme could end up raising borrowing costs for the government, punishing it for fiscal indiscretion.

item9804	If youâ€™re a stubborn person, as I can definitely be at times, then youâ€™ll know that once youâ€™re set on doing something youâ€™ll do it. 
item9805	It doesnâ€™t matter who tells you itâ€™s impossible, that it canâ€™t be done, you still believe it can be.
item9806	The downside, being that stubborn people are far less likely to take othersâ€™ advice, or even want other peopleâ€™s help. 
item9807	It also has the potential to leave people narrow minded and unable to see past what they may be focusing on, which in itself can be both an advantage and disadvantage.
item9808	It perhaps gives people greater focus, but less visibility on any opportunities that may present themselves.

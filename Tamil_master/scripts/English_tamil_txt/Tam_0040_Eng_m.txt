item9428	And a landslide became a probability with every passing day after Mr.Zelensky beat Mr.Poroshenko by a hefty margin in the first round of polling on March thirty one .
item9429	Since Russiaâ€™s seizure of Ukrainian naval vessels in November, Mr.Poroshenko had pitched his campaign merely on the need to bolster national unity against the threat from Moscow, and assert Ukraineâ€™s unique national identity.
item9430	But the final battle turned brutal and bitter, even if the rival candidatesâ€™ campaigns were woefully short on substance.
item9431	Mr.Poroshenko, an ex-oligarch in confectionaries, attacked his opponent as a puppet of another oligarch.
item9432	The reference was to Igor Kolomoisky, whose TV channel ran Mr.Zelenskyâ€™s popular show, and has business interests spanning finance and media.
item9433	The commercial bank he owned was nationalised by the outgoing dispensation as part of an economic clean-up, and Mr.Kolomoisky may have sensed an opportunity in the election to settle scores.
item9434	For his part, Mr.Zelensky used a final pre-election debate in Kiev to argue that his candidacy was a judgment on the incumbent, and that his bid was the result of Mr.Poroshenkoâ€™s mistakes.
item9435	As President, Mr.Zelensky enters uncharted territory.
item9436	The first challenge before him is the parliamentary election later this year, in which he will have to work with established institutions and parties he had railed against during the campaign.
item9437	There is also the continuing conflict with Russia in the rebel-held territories in eastern Ukraine, where his political inexperience might be a serious handicap.
item9438	Finally, Mr.Zelensky will be expected to deliver results in the countryâ€™s crusade against corruption.

item9441	The oil market is in ferment once again with a great deal of uncertainty over supplies.
item9442	On Monday the United States announced that it would not extend beyond May one the one eighty-day waiver it had granted to eight countries, including India, to purchase oil from Iran.
item9443	This caused the price of Brent crude oil to witness a sudden jump to more than dollar seventy five , from last weekâ€™s close of dollar seventy one, as traders expected the withdrawal of the waivers to adversely affect the supply of oil in the market.
item9444	The price of Brent crude, it is worth noting, has been rising steadily in the last few months, and has increased by almost fifty percent since it hit a low of about dollar fifty in December, as a result of the decision of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to restrict their output to boost prices.
item9445	India imports more than ten percent of its crude oil from Iran, so the government faces the immediate challenge of having to find alternative suppliers to meet its huge energy needs.
item9446	Even more worrying is the likely negative impact higher oil prices will have on Indiaâ€™s current account deficit, fiscal deficit and inflation in the wider economy.
item9447	The current account deficit, which narrowed to two point five percent of GDP in the December quarter thanks to lower oil prices, will likely worsen going forward.
item9448	The fiscal deficit, which has been widening in advance of the elections, is also likely to get increasingly out of control.
item9449	While inflation is relatively benign at the moment, any further acceleration in price gains will tie the hands of the Reserve Bank of India.
item9450	It may, however, be hard to say for sure that the jump in the price of oil this week, and over the last few months, marks a secular rise in the price of the commodity.
item9451	The entry of U.S.shale producers into the oil market has put a lid on the price of oil as freely competing shale suppliers have been happy to increase their output whenever oil prices rise significantly.
item9452	Even this week, the oil market has been torn between the news of the end to the waivers granted to oil imports from Iran and competing news of the increased supply of oil pouring into the market from the U.S.Higher oil prices also make it lucrative each time for members of OPEC to cheat on their commitments to restrict supply.

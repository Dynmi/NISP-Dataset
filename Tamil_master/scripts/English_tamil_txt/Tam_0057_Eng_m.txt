item10022	While Mr.Mukherjeeâ€™s seniority and contribution to the polity are not in doubt, the fact that he agreed to speak at an RSS event last year to the bemused disapproval of the Congress party was held out as a reason.
item10023	And more unsympathetically, could the award have been a part of the BJPâ€™s strategy of embracing old Congress leaders such as Vallabhbhai Patel to highlight that its real opposition is to the Nehru-Gandhi family?

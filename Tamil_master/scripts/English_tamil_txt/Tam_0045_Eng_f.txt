item9608	These messages and weather alerts can be disseminated through television, mobile phone messaging and social media platforMs.Urban local bodies in particular have a responsibility to care for the large number of vulnerable city dwellers.
item9609	Yet, few cities have drawn up proper heat action plans to respond to extreme weather or made them public.
item9610	During the current year, there is apprehension that the focus of administrators will mainly be on the conduct of the elections, relegating the public health risk of heat waves to the backburner.
item9611	With the availability of advance weather alerts, there is no reason why local bodies cannot institute remedial measures.
item9612	Mitigating the effect of heat waves is vital to ensuring a high turnout in the elections by making it safe for voters.

item9616	This week, British pragmatism finally found its voice in the U.K.â€™s complex exit process from the European Union.
item9617	The governmentâ€™s deliberations over a withdrawal had been held hostage by the English nationalists among the Conservative party who demand an exit sans an agreement.
item9618	Prime Minister Theresa May, who had long insisted that â€œno deal with Brussels was better than a bad dealâ€?, declared on Tuesday that London would not quit without an accord.
item9619	She clarified she would seek an extension of the April twelve deadline, which she did duly on Friday.
item9620	Parliamentarians are trying to pass legislation that would require the government to avoid a no-deal Brexit â€” it has passed through the Commons by a slim majority and awaits its final stages.
item9621	The government had opposed these moves, initiated by Conservative and Labour MPs in recent parliamentary votes.
item9622	In a bold but risky gambit, Ms.May began talks with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to help break the deadlock.
item9623	While the government has insisted it remains against a customs union, the talks with Labour, which strongly advocates this along with worker and environmental protections, mean that this is inevitably on the table.
item9624	This is resisted vehemently by many Conservatives.
item9625	Few seriously believe that Ms.May and Mr.Corbyn will agree to a deal.
item9626	Equally, the Prime Minister will be severely constrained by the infuriated hardline eurosceptics within her party to not concede too much.
item9627	That would force the government to ask Parliament once again to find a majority for any one of several alternatives, including the thrice-rejected withdrawal accord.
item9628	These â€˜indicativeâ€™ votes failed to deliver a majority to join an EU customs union, offer a second referendum, or revoke Brexit.

item9635	Confidence can be the key to success, but over-confidence? That can be a detriment.
item9636	Having an over-confident attitude can leave people open to weak points in themselves and their business, that they havenâ€™t even considered as being weak yet.
item9637	If youâ€™re overly-confident in that your business or your knowledge is perfect, youâ€™re unable to work on your own weaknesses and areas where you can improve (There will be at least one area always).
item9638	Itâ€™s important to still consider areas where you can improve, and always be improving, rather than neglect it because you think youâ€™ve already covered it completely.

item8796	So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me.

item8800	It now remains for us to do our duty as we have been reminded in the broadcasts of the Prime Minister and Sardar Patel.
item8801	Let us first get the atmosphere rid of the poison which permeates it; let us face, as the Prime Minister exhorts us to do, all the perils that encompass us 'and they are many and grave ' "not madly or badly, but in the way that our beloved teacher taught us to face them".
item8802	Let not anger becloud our vision nor unreasoning passion distort our minds.
item8803	Not for us now petty prejudices and party intrigues and jealousies.

item8810	With turnout usually low (fourty three percent in twenty fourteen), predictions can be tricky, but expectations are that far-right and Eurosceptic parties will make gains.

item8823	Whenever people think they don't have time for something, they're always incorporating their old productivity killing habits into the equation.

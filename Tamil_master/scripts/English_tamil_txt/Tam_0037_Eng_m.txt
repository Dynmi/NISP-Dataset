item0001	The clumsy customer spilled some expensive perfume. 
item0002	Grand auto slid three to fifteen and one eighth on the American Stock Exchange

item0005	Don't ask me to carry an oily rag like that.
item9316	It is hoped that China will take this understanding forward beyond Mr.Xi's speech and help build an infrastructure financing network that is equitable and transparent, especially for smaller states.
item9317	While Mr.Xi's words on transparency and inclusivity will be welcomed in India, they don't address New Delhi's main concern over the BRI, of sovereignty.
item9318	India's objection to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is that it runs through parts of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, and this has led to the Modi government's decision to stay away from the summit.
item9319	India's other concern over the BRI's inroads in South Asia will also grow: at the summit, China listed the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor and the Nepal-China Trans-Himalayan Multi-dimensional Connectivity Network, and the CPEC as focus areas.
item9320	Even so, India has abandoned its sharp rhetoric against the BRI this time compared to twenty seventeen, and China issued statements saying it would not allow the decision to affect the bilateral relationship.
item9321	This was an indicator that both would rather be guided on the issue by the Wuhan spirit than by the deep differences they continue to have over the BRI project.
item9322	Former Vice-President Joseph Biden has finally announced his candidacy for the twenty twenty U.S.presidential election.
item9323	Though the twentie th candidate to join the race for the Democratic ticket, he is among the most prominent â€” he comes with both administrative and legislative experience and has support among establishment Democrats.
item9324	He has joined the race as a front-runner, with one poll seeing a six-point lead for him over his nearest rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
item9325	Mr.Biden also brings into focus the legacy of President Barack Obama.
item9326	Vice-President in the Obama White House for eight years, he has been a strong proponent of the Affordable Care Act and an advocate of free college.
item9327	But compared to his main rivals in the Democratic primaries, such as Senators Sanders and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts â€” one is a self-declared Democratic Socialist and the other is a Social Democrat â€” Mr.Biden is more of a centrist than a leftist insurgent.
item9328	His views on health care, besides his support for Obamacare, are not very well-known.
item9329	He has neither endorsed nor disavowed Medicare for Allâ€?, which has emerged as a major campaign slogan among the Democrats.
item9330	He has not offered any radical economic proposal either, such as, say, Ms.Warren's dollar two trillion education proposal to tackle college costs and student debt traps, or Mr.Sanders's repeated vow to take Wall Street to task.
item9331	The ease with which Mr.Biden raised dollar six million in twenty four hours since he announced his entry into the race suggests that he has the support of big money as well.
item9332	But all this does not ensure that his path to a candidacy would be easy.
item9333	Mr.Biden's most important challenge would be his own record as a legislator.
item9334	He had led the efforts to pass the nineteen ninety four crime Bill, which many liberals and progressives attack for contributing to mass imprisonment, especially of African-American people.
item9335	He co-sponsored the controversial Anti-Drug Abuse Act of nineteen eighty eight, which led to mass arrests, and voted in favour of the Iraq invasion in two thousand two.
item9336	His harsh questioning in nineteen ninety one of Anita Hill, who had accused Clarence Thomas, now a Supreme Court justice, of sexual harassment, has come into focus recently.
item9337	Besides, several women have spoken against Mr.Biden in recent months, alleging that his physical conduct made them feel uncomfortable.
item9338	He has tried to distance himself from this past.
item9339	Earlier this year, he said he wasn't always right' on criminal justice; he regretted his support for the anti-Drug Abuse Act; he has spoken to Ms.Hill in private and vowed to be more mindfulâ€? with women.
item9340	But the question is whether Mr.Biden, with the burden of this record and his centrist politics, will appeal to the base of the Democratic Party at a time when a wide variety of leaders, from Mr.Sanders to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are pushing it to the left of centre.
item9341	There was a blind girl who hated herself purely for the fact she was blind. 
item9342	The only person she didn't hate was her loving boyfriend, as he was always there for her. 
item9343	She said that if she could only see the world, she would marry him.
item9344	One day, someone donated a pair of eyes to her â€“ now she could see everything, including her boyfriend. 
item9345	Her boyfriend asked her, now that you can see the world, will you marry me?â€?
item9346	The girl was shocked when she saw that her boyfriend was blind too, and refused to marry him. 
item9347	Her boyfriend walked away in tears, and later wrote a letter to her saying:
item9348	Just take care of my eyes dear.â€?
item9349	Moral of the story: When our circumstances change, so does our mind. 
item9350	Some people may not be able to see the way things were before, and might not be able to appreciate them. 
item9351	There are many things to take away from this story, not just one.
item9352	This is one of the inspirational short stories that left me speechless.
